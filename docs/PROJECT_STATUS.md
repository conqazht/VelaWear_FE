### Auth Pages Logo Integration Completed

- Replaced text-only logo headers with the stylized brand logo image (`BrandMark` / `/logo.png`) in [auth-shell.tsx](file:///d:/CANH/Java/side%20project/commercial-fe/components/auth/auth-shell.tsx) (used by Sign In page) and [register-page.tsx](file:///d:/CANH/Java/side%20project/commercial-fe/components/auth/register-page.tsx) (used by Register page).
- Downloaded the HTML code for **Vela Wear - Registration Form** ([vela-wear-registration-form.html](file:///d:/CANH/Java/side%20project/commercial-fe/artifacts/vela-wear-registration-form.html)), **Vela Wear - Sign In Refined (Card Style)** ([vela-wear-sign-in-refined.html](file:///d:/CANH/Java/side%20project/commercial-fe/artifacts/vela-wear-sign-in-refined.html)), and **Vela Wear - Sign In** ([vela-wear-sign-in.html](file:///d:/CANH/Java/side%20project/commercial-fe/artifacts/vela-wear-sign-in.html)) using `curl.exe`.

### Member Profile, Help Center Pages Built & Dynamic Header Enabled

- Created [profile/page.tsx](file:///d:/CANH/Java/side%20project/commercial-fe/app/(shop)/profile/page.tsx) rendering the Eleanor member profile card, interests filter grid, and recommended products scroll carousel.
- Created [help/page.tsx](file:///d:/CANH/Java/side%20project/commercial-fe/app/(shop)/help/page.tsx) containing Help topics, categories guides cards, and an interactive state-based FAQ accordion.
- Refined [site-header.tsx](file:///d:/CANH/Java/side%20project/commercial-fe/components/shop/site-header.tsx) to import `usePathname` to enable dynamic header auth:
  - Shows Member initials avatar **"E"** when route is `/profile` (logged in).
  - Shows text link **"Join / Log In"** on other pages (linking to `/profile` as mock trigger).
  - Added "Help" link pointing to `/help` (linking to the Help Center page).
- Verification: ran `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build` successfully. All pages compiled cleanly to static routes.
- Follow-ups: build settings/orders tabs functionality on the profile page.

### Layout Broadened (Nike-style) & Logo Simplified

- Removed the text wordmark `VELA WEAR` from [brand-mark.tsx](file:///d:/CANH/Java/side%20project/commercial-fe/components/shop/brand-mark.tsx), leaving only the stylized "V" icon at `h-10` according to the Stitch template.
- Expanded the layout grid container maximum width across the site from `1280px` (`max-w-7xl`) to **`1800px`** (`max-w-[1800px]`) with horizontal padding set to `px-6 md:px-16`. This affects the Header, Featured Categories grid, Trending Now product list, Story section, and Footer, creating a wide layout style matching Nike.com.
- Updated [globals.css](file:///d:/CANH/Java/side%20project/commercial-fe/app/globals.css) to import Google Fonts (Inter, Cormorant Garamond) and correct variables/theme color definitions (like Terracotta primary `#b5573a` and surface-card `#efe7dc`).
- Reconstructed [home-page.tsx](file:///d:/CANH/Java/side%20project/commercial-fe/components/shop/home-page.tsx) with interactive Hero slider, Featured categories grid, Trending product scroll carousel, and dark Story section.
- Verification: ran `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build` successfully with zero compiler/lint errors.
- Follow-ups: check that other interior pages match the wider container layout.

- Downloaded the corresponding screenshot ([vela-wear-enhanced-editorial-homepage.png](file:///d:/CANH/Java/side%20project/commercial-fe/artifacts/vela-wear-enhanced-editorial-homepage.png)) and HTML code ([vela-wear-enhanced-editorial-homepage.html](file:///d:/CANH/Java/side%20project/commercial-fe/artifacts/vela-wear-enhanced-editorial-homepage.html)) using `curl.exe`.
